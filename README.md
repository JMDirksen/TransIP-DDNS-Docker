# TransIP DDNS Docker

Create a docker container for updating a TransIP DNS record with the current public IP address.
It monitors the current public IP address and when it changes it updates the DNS record hosted at TransIP.
It does this every 4:30 to 5:00 minutes to make sure the DNS record is always up-to-date.


# Using

This project uses:
- [IPInfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) API for getting the public IP address
- [transip/tipctl](https://github.com/transip/tipctl) TransIP Control the official TransIP RestAPI CLI for setting the IP address
- [php:cli-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) Official php:cli-alpine docker image


# Usage / Commands

## Run container

Put your private key in a file called `private.key` and run the container with the following command:

docker run -it \
  -e LOGINNAME=myusername \
